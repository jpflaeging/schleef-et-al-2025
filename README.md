Title: Frequency-Based Professionalism Evaluation of (ING) and (T)-Deletion in England and Pennsylvania Authors: Erik Schleef, Bradley Mackay, Jana Pflaeging Year: 2025 Journal: Journal of English Linguistics

Abstract: This study investigates the social evaluation of linguistic variation and the cognitive monitoring processes involved. Recognizing the need for cross-regional research that keeps experimental factors constant, we focus on (ING) and (T)-deletion. We investigate frequency evaluation as managed in England, UK (N=200), and in Pennsylvania, US (N=150). Results for (ING) indicate no significant effect of [ɪn]-frequency in England, while in Pennsylvania the frequency of [ɪn] significantly affects ratings regarding perceived professionalism. We also found evidence for listeners’ awareness of the attitude target (N=15) to affect their ratings regarding perceived professionalism. Variation in (T)-deletion did not prompt any significant differences.
